# Project Idea
For my project, I worked off of the reseaerch question, "Can humanity be trusted with nature without causing adversity?" The idea was to make a short commentary on how humans use nature to their advantage, the way humans interact with natural, previously untouched environments, the thought process and idea behind modifying natural spaces for our benefit and how we essentially may be wired to cause destruction to nature despite our efforts to preserve it in some areas. There seems to be a lot of emphasis in the present day on climate change, endangered species and how we need to treat our environment with more care. I think it’s interesting how we’re trying to take this turn after spending so much time taking advantage of the world around us with little regard for the consequences, and how we continue to do so despite being aware of the damage we’re causing. 
# Proccess Explanation
To start, I gathered a few videos I had previously taken of nature around where I live. I took several more for this project only, of more animals (mostly birds) and some places that had evidence of humans, like littering or construction. I took some of these clips on campus also when i came across something that fit, the warehouse for example. I then edited these clips together with a focus shifting from nature to humans' affect on it. I also showed this by adjusting the colors of the videos; it started out overly saturated and lost color over time.
